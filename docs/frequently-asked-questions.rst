Basic Questions

If I return an ``enum``, I only get integer values in web3.js. How to get the named values?
===========================================================================================

Enums are not supported by the ABI, they are just supported by Solidity.
You have to do the mapping yourself for now, we might provide some help
later.

Get return value from non-constant function from another contract
=================================================================

The key point is that the calling contract needs to know about the function it intends to call.

See `ping.sol <https://github.com/fivedogit/solidity-baby-steps/blob/master/contracts/45_ping.sol>`_
and `pong.sol <https://github.com/fivedogit/solidity-baby-steps/blob/master/contracts/45_pong.sol>`_.
